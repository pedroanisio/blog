# Domain-Driven Design Specification for the OpenAI Playground

## 1. Core Domain and Vision

**Core Domain**:  
The OpenAI Playground’s core domain is to provide an interactive environment where users can experiment with language models by submitting prompts and receiving responses in real-time. 

**Vision**:  
- Let users **compose, configure, and refine prompts** with immediate feedback.  
- Provide **tools and parameters** that control and guide the language model’s output.  
- Make it simple for **developers and non-developers** alike to prototype and understand how large language models (LLMs) respond.

---

## 2. Ubiquitous Language

1. **User**: A person (or service account) interacting with the Playground.  
2. **Prompt**: The text input from a User that instructs the language model on what to generate.  
3. **Response**: The text generated by the language model based on a Prompt.  
4. **Parameters**: Configuration values (e.g., temperature, max tokens, top_p) that influence how the LLM generates Responses.  
5. **Model**: The specific LLM being used (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4).  
6. **Session**: A continuous interaction scenario where a User sets a Model and Parameters, submits Prompts, and receives Responses.  
7. **Token**: A unit of text (roughly 3–4 characters in English) used to measure usage and cost.  
8. **Token Limit**: The maximum allowed tokens for a single request-response cycle, also used for cost control and to respect model constraints.  
9. **Usage**: Accumulated tokens or requests linked to a User’s account (for billing or quota enforcement).  
10. **Chat Mode**: A specialized way of sending multiple messages in the form of “User,” “System,” and “Assistant” roles.  
11. **Completion Mode**: A single-block prompt/response interaction (the more “classic” GPT-3 style).  
12. **Draft**: A scenario where the Playground stores partial prompts or user instructions for reuse or further editing.

## 3. Bounded Contexts

Domain-Driven Design suggests splitting the overall system into **Bounded Contexts** that encapsulate specific parts of the domain. For the Playground, we can propose three main contexts:

### 3.1. **Interaction Context**

- **Purpose**:  
  Manages the core interaction between the User and the Model—i.e., capturing Prompts, applying Parameters, and returning Responses.

- **Key Concepts**:  
  1. **Prompt** (Entity or Value Object)  
  2. **Response** (Value Object)  
  3. **Session** (Aggregate)  
  4. **Parameters** (Value Object)

- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Storing session state (current Prompt, last Response, selected Model, Parameter settings).  
  - Coordinating with the Model Service (in the Model Management Context) to generate Responses.  
  - Managing token usage limits in real-time for each session.

- **Example Entities/Aggregates**:
  - **Session**:  
    - *Identifier*: sessionId  
    - *Attributes*: sessionState, activeModel, userId, lastPromptId, lastResponseId, parameterSetId  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: addPrompt(), generateResponse(), endSession(), updateParameters()

  - **Prompt**:  
    - *Identifier*: promptId  
    - *Attributes*: text, timestamp, associatedParameters, sessionId  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: validatePrompt(), storePrompt()

  - **ParameterSet**:  
    - *Attributes*: temperature, maxTokens, topP, frequencyPenalty, presencePenalty

  - **Response**:  
    - *Attributes*: text, tokensUsed, timestamp, sessionId  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: storeResponse(), associatePrompt(promptId)

### 3.2. **Model Management Context**

- **Purpose**:  
  Deals with the specifics of which model(s) are available, how they are selected, and any constraints or advanced configuration needed.

- **Key Concepts**:  
  1. **Model** (Entity)  
  2. **Model Capability** (Value Object)  
  3. **Model Constraints** (Value Object)  

- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Providing available Models and their capabilities (e.g., code generation, maximum token limit).  
  - Handling versioning or updates to Models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4).  
  - Exposing an interface (e.g., a domain service) to retrieve or change Model information.

- **Example Entities/Aggregates**:
  - **Model**:  
    - *Identifier*: modelId (e.g., “gpt-3.5-turbo”)  
    - *Attributes*: name, version, maximumContextSize, capabilities (e.g., chat, code), costPerToken  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: checkAvailability(), getConstraints()

- **Domain Services**:  
  - **ModelSelectionService**: Takes a user request (required features, cost constraints) and returns the best-matching Model.

### 3.3. **Account & Usage Context**

- **Purpose**:  
  Tracks user information, authentication, usage statistics, and billing.

- **Key Concepts**:  
  1. **User** (Aggregate)  
  2. **UsageRecord** (Entity)  
  3. **Subscription / BillingPlan** (Entity)  

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Managing user registration, login, and authentication.  
  - Tracking token usage (UsageRecord) for cost or quota enforcement.  
  - Managing subscription tiers or free usage limits.  
  - Handling billing events (e.g., monthly invoice, usage-based charges).

- **Example Entities/Aggregates**:
  - **User**:  
    - *Identifier*: userId  
    - *Attributes*: email, subscriptionPlan, usageLimit, role (admin, developer, etc.)  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: registerUser(), authenticate(), updateSubscriptionPlan()

  - **UsageRecord**:  
    - *Identifier*: usageRecordId  
    - *Attributes*: userId, sessionId, tokensUsed, timestamp  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: accumulateUsage(), enforceUsageLimit()

  - **BillingPlan**:  
    - *Attributes*: planName, monthlyLimit, costPerToken, costPerRequest  
    - *Behavior/Methods*: calculateUsageFee()

## 4. Context Map

```
+---------------------------+        +---------------------------+
|   Interaction Context     | --->   |   Model Management Ctx    |
| (Prompts, Sessions, etc.)|        | (Models, Constraints)     |
+------------+--------------+        +------------+--------------+
             |                                     ^
             |                                     |
             v                                     |
+---------------------------+        +-------------+------------+
| Account & Usage Context  | <----> |   (Domain Services)       |
|(User mgmt, Billing, etc.)|        +---------------------------+
```

1. **Interaction Context -> Model Management Context**  
   - **Upstream/Downstream**: Interaction Context consumes the Model Management service to generate responses.  
   - The Model Management Context acts as an upstream service specifying which models are available and handling the actual call to the LLM.

2. **Interaction Context -> Account & Usage Context**  
   - The Interaction Context sends usage data (tokens, calls) to the Account & Usage Context for tracking and billing.  
   - Account & Usage Context can also broadcast usage-limit events to Interaction Context.

3. **Account & Usage Context**  
   - Maintains user entitlements and usage. It’s partially downstream from the Interaction Context (because it receives usage data) but also can restrict new requests if the user is over quota.

---

## 5. Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects

### 5.1. Aggregates

1. **Session** (Interaction Context)  
   - Root Entity for a user’s ongoing interactions.  
   - Contains references to `Prompt` and `Response` objects.  

2. **User** (Account & Usage Context)  
   - Root Entity for everything related to user identity, subscription, usage.  
   - Contains `UsageRecord` or references to it.  

3. **BillingPlan** (Account & Usage Context)  
   - Separate Aggregate that can be referenced by `User`.  
   - Defines rules for usage limits, costs, etc.

### 5.2. Entities vs. Value Objects

- **Prompt**: Could be an Entity if you want to uniquely track prompts across sessions. But often it can be a Value Object if ephemeral.  
- **Response**: Similar reasoning as Prompt—often ephemeral or purely generated. Typically a Value Object.  
- **ParameterSet**: Usually a Value Object since it’s a set of configurations with no identity beyond its values.  
- **UsageRecord**: An Entity that might require an ID because it’s used for billing audits.

---

## 6. Domain Services

1. **GenerateResponseService** (Interaction Context)  
   - Coordinates with the **Model Management Context** to invoke the correct model.  
   - Applies the ParameterSet to the user’s Prompt.  
   - Returns a Response object along with token usage.  
   - Publishes an event (e.g., `ResponseGenerated`) to the Account & Usage Context.

2. **ModelSelectionService** (Model Management Context)  
   - Logic for deciding which model to use based on user preference, system defaults, or advanced constraints.

3. **UsageEnforcementService** (Account & Usage Context)  
   - Checks if the user has enough credits or is within the usage limits.  
   - Raises domain events (`UsageLimitExceeded`) if the user surpasses the limit.

---

## 7. Domain Events

1. **PromptSubmitted**  
   - Emitted when a user posts a new Prompt to a Session.  
   - Triggers usage checks and possibly Model selection logic.

2. **ResponseGenerated**  
   - Published when the system successfully generates a Response.  
   - Includes data on tokens consumed and session context.

3. **UsageLimitExceeded**  
   - Emitted by the Account & Usage Context if the user has gone beyond their quota.  
   - Can cause the Interaction Context to block further prompts.

4. **SessionEnded**  
   - Signals the closure of a session.  
   - The Interaction Context finalizes the session’s usage data and sends it to Account & Usage for billing.

---

## 8. Application Services (Use Cases)

Here are some high-level application services (often called “use case services”) that orchestrate actions across contexts:

1. **StartSessionUseCase**  
   - Inputs: userId, initialModel, initialParameters  
   - Flow:  
     1. Validate user’s subscription.  
     2. Create a new Session entity.  
     3. Return sessionId to the client.

2. **SubmitPromptUseCase**  
   - Inputs: sessionId, promptText  
   - Flow:  
     1. Check if the session is active.  
     2. Create a new Prompt object.  
     3. Publish `PromptSubmitted` event.  
     4. Interact with **GenerateResponseService**.  
     5. Store the resulting Response in the Session.  
     6. Publish `ResponseGenerated` event (with token usage).

3. **ViewUsageUseCase**  
   - Inputs: userId  
   - Flow:  
     1. Fetch usage records and subscription details.  
     2. Return aggregated usage stats to user.

4. **ChangeModelUseCase**  
   - Inputs: sessionId, newModelId  
   - Flow:  
     1. Validate that the new model is available (via Model Management Context).  
     2. Update the Session’s activeModel.  
     3. Possibly adjust parameter constraints or token limits.

5. **EndSessionUseCase**  
   - Inputs: sessionId  
   - Flow:  
     1. Mark Session as ended.  
     2. Publish `SessionEnded` event, triggers final usage check/billing.

---

## 9. Implementation Considerations

1. **API Layer**  
   - REST or GraphQL endpoints (e.g., `/sessions`, `/prompts`, `/models`) handle incoming requests, map them to Use Cases.  
   - WebSocket endpoints or SSE (Server-Sent Events) could be used for real-time usage/billing notifications.

2. **Integration with OpenAI’s API**  
   - The **GenerateResponseService** calls an external OpenAI API for the chosen model.  
   - This external dependency typically resides in the **Model Management Context** as an infrastructure detail or anti-corruption layer.

3. **Infrastructure & Persistence**  
   - Could store `Session`, `Prompt`, and `Response` in a database keyed by `sessionId`.  
   - Could store `User` and `UsageRecord` in a separate database or the same, depending on scale and read/write patterns.

4. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Must ensure authentication at every user action.  
   - Must handle prompts that contain sensitive or personal data responsibly (i.e., never log them in plain text or keep them longer than necessary).

5. **Scalability**  
   - Since real-time text generation can be heavy, the application might rely on asynchronous event-driven architecture (publish/subscribe) to handle large volumes of requests.

---

## 10. Sample Workflow

1. **User Logs In** (Account & Usage Context)  
2. **User Starts a Session** (Interaction Context)  
   - `StartSessionUseCase` triggers creation of `Session` aggregate with default `ParameterSet`.  
3. **User Submits Prompt** (Interaction Context)  
   - `PromptSubmitted` event is fired.  
   - `GenerateResponseService` calls external LLM API (in Model Management Context).  
   - `ResponseGenerated` event is published with token usage.  
4. **Usage Context Updates**  
   - Receives `ResponseGenerated`, calculates token usage, updates `UsageRecord`.  
   - If usage is near the limit, a warning or `UsageLimitExceeded` event might be published.  
5. **User Ends Session** (Interaction Context)  
   - `SessionEnded` event finalizes usage for the session.

# Summary

This DDD specification breaks down the **OpenAI Playground** into clearly scoped bounded contexts:

- **Interaction Context**: Manages the real-time exchange of prompts and responses.  
- **Model Management Context**: Manages the details of which models are available and how they’re invoked.  
- **Account & Usage Context**: Handles user identity, usage tracking, and billing.

Within these contexts, we define Aggregates (e.g., **Session**, **User**, **BillingPlan**) and identify domain services (e.g., **GenerateResponseService**, **ModelSelectionService**, **UsageEnforcementService**) that coordinate core behaviors. Domain events (such as **PromptSubmitted**, **ResponseGenerated**, and **UsageLimitExceeded**) serve as integration points between the contexts.

This structure sets a foundation for **maintainable, scalable, and evolvable** software design, ensuring that each part of the Playground handles its own concerns and communicates through well-defined contracts and events.
